In this tutorial we'll make a couple of simple apps to get you started.

### Prerequisites
1. Shiny - `install.packages("shiny")` 
2. Tidyverse - `install.packages("tidyverse")`
3. Palmer Penguins - `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`

### App 1
Boilerplate Shiny App (comes with Shiny) that builds a simple web app using [Old Faithful Geyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful) in Yellowstone National Park(`faithful`) data. We'll use this to understand the structure of a Shiny App

### App 2
Build a simple Shiny App that prints out exactly what you type in

### App 3

A shiny app that can be used to exploratory data analysis. Uses the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) - `palmerpenguins`
